Generation loss in images refers to the deterioration of image quality caused by repeated copying or compression. 
Each instance of copying or compression introduces loss or alteration of information, resulting in a cumulative, 
decrease in overall image quality. The loss of details, color accuracy, sharpness, and visual fidelity gradually,
worsens with each generation, akin to the game of "Telephone."

To run the code you need python installed as well as the PIL library.
Open a terminal or a shell of your liking and execute 'python GenLoss.py'.
After that follow the instructions that are given to you by the prompts and
have fun degrading images!
