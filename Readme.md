Generation loss in images refers to the deterioration of image quality caused by repeated copying or compression. 
Each instance of copying or compression introduces loss or alteration of information, resulting in a cumulative, 
decrease in overall image quality. The loss of details, color accuracy, sharpness, and visual fidelity gradually,
worsens with each generation, akin to the game of "Telephone."
